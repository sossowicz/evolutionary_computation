Analysis
Convergence speed
---------------------------------------------------------
All initially converge quite quick, smoothing out and steadily improving approaching 20000
ALG 1 : Across all populations, initially converges faster. Higher populations less obvious.
Fitness proportional selection is biased towards best individuals which leads to rapid gain but premature convergence and loss of diversity. 
ALG 2 : Always slightly worse fitness than ALG3, but better than all 1.
Tournament selection generally maintains pop diversity better than FPS, more consistent throughout reps than ALG1
ALG 3 : Best convergence speed.
Combination of factors lead to speed similar to ALG2, but converges slightly faster

Convergence smoothness
---------------------------------------------------------
Generally all algorithms have better convergence smoothness on higher pop sizes
ALG 1 : Jumps around a lot, occasionally has long periods of no fitness gain and sometimes has large fitness gain suddenly
FPS can lead to domination of a few high fitness individuals which can lead to a loss of diversity / periods of stagnation. See POP20 Rep 10 to see flatline.
ALG 2 : Generally smooth and consistent, rarely has large jumps in fitness but steadily increases
You see jumps in fitness in POP50 Rep 13, but generally not in other samples
ALG 3 : Has a smooth increase often throughout all population sizes
ALG 2 and 3 maintains a better population diversity, facilitating consistent gains in fitness by not getting stuck on bad solutions

Variability across repetitions
---------------------------------------------------------
ALG 1 : Has high variability, will sometimes be close to ALG 2 but often be far off
Gets stuck on solutions, but also very exploratory so can be better in some cases. See POP20 Rep 4 where it is better than ALG 2 until Gen5000.
ALG 2 : Fitness is relatively consistent, however is has a bigger range than ALG 3
Bigger range because PMX and insert don't explore well all the time.
ALG 3 : Very consistent end fitness on all population sizes
Good combination of selection and seems to be reliable

The algorithm you would choose and why
---------------------------------------------------------
ALG3 because it is the most consistent of the three. It explores well but does not get stuck on bad solutions
