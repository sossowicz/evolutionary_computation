In the Inver-Over algorithm, running it 30 times with a population size of 50 for 20,000 generations consistently produced high-quality solutions for the TSP. Compared to earlier experiments with our 3 algorithms, Inver-Over achieved superior results in terms of both best and median fitness. This indicates its effectiveness in solving the TSP and makes it valuable for comparison with our custom 3 algorithms. Notably, Inver-Over showed the best fitness across all 4 algorithms and displayed the lowest variance, highlighting its potential as a robust optimization approach. Finally, its best tour closely resembled the given optimal tour, highlighting its efficiency in finding optimal solutions.
