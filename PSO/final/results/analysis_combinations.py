Analysis and Comparison:
We've analyzed and compared the performance of the different combinations tested in the previous section. The goal was to find the best combination, considering the interactions between swarm size, weight adjustment, and topology.

Best Combination: After careful evaluation, the combination that emerged as the most promising was a moderate swarm size (e.g., 100), a non-linear inertia weight adjustment (with n=2), and a gbest topology. This combination consistently showed balanced exploration and exploitation capabilities, leading to faster convergence and improved final results.

Interactions Impact: Interestingly, we observed that certain combinations, especially those with larger swarm sizes in combination with certain topologies and weight adjustment, tended to slow down convergence and occasionally lead to poor final fitness results. It suggests that in some cases, the interactions between these factors can indeed worsen performance. Examples:
- Small Swarm Size (e.g., 20) with Star Topology and No Weight Adjustment
- Large Swarm Size (e.g., 200) with Random Topology and No Weight Adjustment

Practical Implications: The choice of combination depends on the specific problem and computational resources. Smaller swarm sizes are computationally more efficient but might require more time for convergence. Conversely, larger swarms (200) might reach solutions faster but consume more resources.

In summary, the choice of combination is problem-dependent. For faster convergence and better results, the combination of moderate swarm size, non-linear inertia weight adjustment (n=2), and a gbest topology is recommended.
