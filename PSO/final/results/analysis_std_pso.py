Variability across runs: Due to the inherent randomness of particle swarm algorithms, runs exhibit notable variability. Different random initializations and particle interactions lead to different optimization trajectories. The convergence of the runs is relatively consistent with all converging before iteration hits 100 as seen on metrics_std_pso_zoom.

Convergence performance: On average, particle swarm algorithms take about 50-75 iterations to convergence. Initially, as the algorithm explores the solution space, the "best fitness" metric drops rapidly. However, after several hundred iterations, the rate of improvement almost flatlines as the algorithm fine-tuned its solution.

Population convergence: The population usually converges towards global optimality, as shown by the decrement value of the "Swcenter to Globalopt" indicator. This shows that as optimization proceeds, the population collectively moves toward the global minimum.

Close to optimal: Close to true optimal (the global minimum of Ackley's function) is different in different runs. Some runs are very close to the global optimal, while others stay relatively far from the global minimum. This variation can be attributed to randomness in the initialization and search processes. The best runs almost get to 0 (global minimum) while there is a good range of runs that hover between 1-3.

In short, the convergence behavior of standard particle swarm optimization algorithm shows variability in different initialization processes. While the population tends to converge towards the global optimal, the exact proximity to the global minimum varies between runs. Further analysis, such as examining the distribution of final fitness values, can provide more insight into the algorithm's performance.
