Convergence rate: The convergence rate of the improved particle swarm after adjusting the nonlinear inertial weight is faster than that of the standard particle swarm. This can be observed in the "best fitness" plot, where the modified PSO achieves lower fitness values in fewer iterations.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: Nonlinear inertial weight adjustment can better balance exploration and exploitation. Therefore, the improved particle swarm can explore the search space more efficiently and find better solutions.

Population size impact: Comparing the results of different population sizes with the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, it is clear that larger population sizes help to improve the rate of convergence, but do not necessarily guarantee a better final solution. Smaller group sizes may converge more slowly, but good solutions can still be found.

End result: The improved particle swarm with nonlinear inertial weight adjustment consistently produces better end results than the standard particle swarm. This is evident in the lower fitness values obtained in the "best fitness" plot.

In summary, compared with the standard particle swarm, the nonlinear inertial weight adjustment improves the convergence speed and the quality of the final solution. However, when applying this modification, the tradeoff between group size and speed of convergence must be considered. When computing resources are limited, smaller group sizes may be preferred. Overall, the nonlinear inertial weight adjustment is a valuable enhancement to the particle swarm optimization algorithm, thus improving the optimization performance.
